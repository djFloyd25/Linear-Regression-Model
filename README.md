# Linear-Regression-Model
Learned how to implement linear regression in code without libraries

In this project, I used my knowledge of linear regression to implement
the math for the model. I made a loss function and a gradient descent function
that utilized partial derivatives. I then ran through this loop which is necessary
for the actual linear regression. I got to learn about adjusting my learning rate because
the x values were so high I had to set a very low learning rate so the model could run. I 
found that 300 epochs was a good number for the model.
